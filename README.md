# 2024-odin-landing-page

The project is a landing page. It demonstrates the basic HTML and CSS knowledge I learned on The Odin Project. The landing page consists of the main index page linked to a styles.css stylesheet.

The knowledge applied to this project are as follows:

1. HTML:
    i. HTML Boilerplate
    ii. Basic text elements (e.g. h1, p, etc.)
    iii. Lists (e.g. ul, li)
    iv. Links and images
    v. Use of class attributes

2. CSS:
    i. Selectors (e.g. Type, Chaining, Class, Grouping, etc.)
    ii. Basic CSS properties (e.g. color, background-color, etc.)
    iii. Proper knowledge of specificity, inheritance, and rule order
    iv. Linking external CSS stylesheet to index.html
    v. Proper knowledge of the box model (e.g. margins, paddings)
    vi. Use of flexbox
    vii. Proper knowledge of the main and cross axes
